# Latin Variants Translator

UPDATE: No longer maintained due to complexity of some languages (e.g. Pig Latin)

A translator for Pig Latin, Egg Latin, and Bacon Omelette Latin.

My first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: The translators WILL NOT BE PERFECT. There will be several bugs all the translators, so I'd really appreciate it if you can open an issue or a pull request to help fix these.
