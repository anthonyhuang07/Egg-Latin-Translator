# Egg Latin + English Translator

A translator for English and Egg Latin, able to translate forwards and back.

My first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: If you're using Egg Latin => English and the piece of text contains the word "Egg" in it, it will bug out and will not show in the translation result. That is an issue that will be fixed in the future.
