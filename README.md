# Egg Latin Translator

A translator for English and Egg Latin, able to translate forwards and back.

My first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: If you're using Egg Latin => English and the piece of text contains the word "Egg" in it, it ~~will bug out and will not show in the translation result.~~ UPDATE: Did a quick fix method, will now capitalize the english word "Egg", then return a lowercased version. So this issue does not apply anymore.
