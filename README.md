# Egg Latin + English Translator

A translator for English and Egg Latin, able to translate forwards and back.

My first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: If you're using Egg Latin => English and the piece of text contains the word "Egg" in it, it ~~will bug out and will not show in the translation result.~~ UPDATE: Did a quick fix method, it will now return Egg if you have a word with "egg" in it, so expect random capitalizations if you're typing words like "dreggier" (Outputted result will be "drEggier")
