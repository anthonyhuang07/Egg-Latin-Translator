# Latin Variants Translator

A translator for Pig Latin, Egg Latin, and Bacon Omelette Latin.

My first project using TypeScript.

**NOTE**: Egg Latin may be broken, typing 2 words that end with `y` and don't include a vowel will bug out and the rest of the text will not translate. This is a bug that will be fixed soon. Another issue with Pig Latin - punctuation can be bugged sometimes. Just don't spam punctuation and you'll be fine
